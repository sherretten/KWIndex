<h1> What I Did <h1>
<h4>Nathaniel Sherrett, Rust Winter 2020, 2/4/2020</h4>
<p> For homework 3 we were assigned to create a basic word analyzer with rust. The purpose of this homework was to get us more comfortable with lifetimes in rust as well as tuple-structs. We created a data type KWIndex, or keyword-Index, that stores a vector, so basically we were just working with a vector with a parent. We added some base functions and got more familiar with closures/lambda functions in rust. </p>

<h1> How it went </h1>
<p> Overall, this project definitely fine tuned my knowledge of closures, structs and lifetimes in rust. I spent a long time dealing with reference issues in count matches and the other 2 basic functions required less time. The extend_text function was difficult, but after some trouble shooting it was definitely a reachable task. </p>
<h1> How I tested my work</h1>
<p>I spent a large amount of time creating 10 test cases for my work. Some of them were giving me trouble, but definitely proved useful. Check out the unit.rs file in the tests directory for more info.</p>
